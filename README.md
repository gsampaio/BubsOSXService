==============

Mac OSX Service for changing the selected text to bubs.

Make sure to have [bubs](https://github.com/holman/bubs) installed on your system. If you don't install running the following command. 

`$ gem install bubs`

To take full advantage of the service it's highly recommended to create a keyboard shortcut on the Keyboard Preference Panel. 

## Thanks

Special thanks to [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman) for envisioning and creating bubs.
